            <p class="schedule-event">Jared Spool: Is Design Metrically Opposed?</p>
            <p class="schedule-time">10:00-11:30am</p>
            <p class="schedule-intro">The world of metrics and analytics have often been at odds with how designers
                work. Design is a process where we finely tune our intuition to create great user experiences. Yet,
                sometimes, what we think is best rivals the metrics. So which do we believe - our gut or the data? In
                the world of measures, metrics, and Key Performance Indicators some practices, like the growth hacking
                approach to increasing Monthly Average Users (MAUs), have hurt the online experience of Instagram and
                LinkedIn. While alternatives to satisfaction and net promoter score give insight into the design process
                and help designers have better instincts. If you’re ready to talk to your teams about what you really
                need, help management interpret the data, and create analytical experiments that provide design
                insights, don’t miss this talk.

                This talk will show you and your team:

                What easily-collected analytics, like bounce rate and time-on-page, actually tell us about our users’
                experiences.
                Why advanced techniques, like a money-left-on-the-table analysis and the CE11, show us how metrics can
                impact design.
                Why asking, ”Would you recommend this?“ isn’t an ideal way to measure brand engagement.</p>

            <p class="schedule-event">Jake Knapp: Design Sprint Talk</p>
            <p class="schedule-time">1:30pm-2:30pm</p>
            <p class="schedule-intro">To help teams at Google build better products faster, Jake Knapp created the
                Design Sprint. It’s a step-by-step process combining strategy, design thinking, behavioral science, and
                Lean Startup-style rapid learning. It also happens to be a lot of fun. Jake has run the method over 150
                times with startups like Slack, Nest, 23andme, and Uber. His book Sprint was an instant bestseller and
                today teams around the world are adopting the Design Sprint. With stories and illustrated examples, Jake
                will explain the unconventional wisdom behind the Design Sprint—and show how any team can use the
                process to find innovative solutions and try risky ideas fast. </p>

            <p class="schedule-event">Kate Rutter: Chunky Learning on Slender Timelines</p>
            <p class="schedule-time">3:00-5:00pm</p>
            <p class="schedule-intro">The UX field continues to evolve, and the tools and skills we need to perform our
                jobs with it. Seasoned professionals are often strapped for time and struggle to incorporate learning
                new skills into their schedules, while early-career teammates may have knowledge of the latest and
                greatest but lack overall experience and take time to onboard. Where can we find a sweet spot that
                allows teams to grow their skills and experiences together?

                Kate shares her model for creating a culture of continuous learning in companies. She'll share
                experiences leading a successful UX adult learning program based on a framework of how people learn, and
                give concrete examples of learning tools you can apply immediately in your organization.</p>

            <p class="schedule-time">1:30pm-4:00pm</p>
            <p class="schedule-intro">Quantitative metrics are an underutilized tool in most user experience efforts. In
                this workshop, you'll identify the critical metrics for delivering great user experiences. You’ll learn
                how to turn metrics into an essential storytelling tool, that demonstrate the wide-scale effect better
                designs can have on your organization. You’ll explore different types of UX metrics, from success
                metrics that tell you when your designs have achieved your desired outcomes, to exploratory metrics that
                open up new avenues of creativity, value, and competitive innovation. Jared will show you new ways UX
                design leaders are using metrics to drive a better understanding of how UX design delivers value.</p>
